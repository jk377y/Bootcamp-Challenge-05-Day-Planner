# Work Day Scheduler


## Description
This is an app that will allow the user to enter specifically timed events. Once the save button is clicked, these events are stored into local storage. Upon page reload, these values persists. Each hour-blocked section is color coded to compare the time blocks to the current hour and color them according to a past, present or future designated color.
